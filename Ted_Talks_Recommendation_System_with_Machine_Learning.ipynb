And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra, an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali, and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. All the young people, actually, from the city. The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha, because when he came to their city he accepted \\u2014 he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is, and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person, raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling: \\\"He's supposed to be religious and all this. What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,\\\" and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him. They wouldn't go listen to him. But the young people all came. And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground. And as soon as they had laid all these, all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India, he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium, the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it, and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. So they don't \\u2014 when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky \\u2014 they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. And then Leilei \\u2014 I know his other name \\u2014 told us about interconnection, and how we're all totally interconnected here, and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe, we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past. And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth. And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters, if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet.And therefore it will become intolerable \\u2014 what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us, totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is, and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place, or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. It just becomes intolerable. With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do, a little bit tired, we do suffer. We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own, and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.Because our egocentric perception \\u2014 from the Buddha's point of view, misperception \\u2014 is that all we are is what is inside our skin. And it's inside and outside, self and other, and other is all very different. And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception, a little bit, right? You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat \\u2014 that's OK because you're in a theater, but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you, you'd freak out. What do they want from me? Like, who's that? And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe \\u2014 that's all Buddha discovered. Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us, and everyone else is different, then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it? Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world? Who's going to get enough out of the world? Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings \\u2014 if you're different from all the other beings?So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way: through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually, knowing that you have no such boundary, knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel. Luckily, they say \\u2014 I still am not sure \\u2014 but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature, they say, \\\"Oh who would really want to be compassionate? How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching. My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough. I need a hundred billion.\\\" So I'm like that. Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. It would be terrible.But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life. When you're no longer locked in yourself, and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out, and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing, and realizing that you are the other being, somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can, you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine, like the Beatles used to sing.You know, we really learned everything in the '60s. Too bad nobody ever woke up to it, and they've been trying to suppress it since then. I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching. But when we're relieved from that, we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange. It's totally strange. The Dalai Lama always likes to say \\u2014 he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion, it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know \\u2014 and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets. Like, even when you're having a good time, when is the good time over? The good time is over when you think, how good is it? And then it's never good enough.I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time, doing it by having a good time. I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. He once told me \\u2014 he looked kind of sad; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots. He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago, they went and took everything away from the haves. You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth. They took it all away by violence, saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse. They didn't help at all.So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today? And so then he looks at me. So I said, \\\"Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,\\\" was all I could think of. What is virtue? But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun. It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring, and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly. Even though his people are being genocided \\u2014 and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head, in every Chinese prison. He feels it. He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. I won't even say what they do. But he feels it. And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.Because when you open up like that, then you can't just \\u2014 what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery? You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. She scared us with the lava man is coming, then the tsunami is coming, but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful. It's really lovely.So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others, and the human being actually is compassion. The human being is almost out of time. The human being is compassion because what is our brain for? Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did. He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. And he would have tremendous fun doing that.So the first person who gets happy, when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I, where you're always dissatisfied \\u2014 as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. So then you decide, \\\"Well, I'm sick of myself. I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. I'm going to get up in the morning and think, what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?\\\" And the first person who gets happy when you do that, you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself, because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. And you realize that this \\u2014 being with these people \\u2014 is the flower garden that Chiho showed us. It is Nirvana. And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments. Thank you.\",\n          \"When I was six years old, I received my gifts. My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea. She wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of complimenting each other. So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner. And she said, \\\"Why don't we just stand here and compliment each other? If you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down.\\\" What a wonderful idea, right? What could go wrong?(Laughter)Well, there were 40 of us to start with, and every time I heard someone's name called, I would give out the heartiest cheer. And then there were 20 people left, and 10 people left, and five left ... and three left. And I was one of them. And the compliments stopped. Well, at that moment, I was crying. And the teacher was freaking out. She was like, \\\"Hey, would anyone say anything nice about these people?\\\"(Laughter)\\\"No one? OK, why don't you go get your gift and sit down. So behave next year \\u2014 someone might say something nice about you.\\\"(Laughter)Well, as I'm describing this you, you probably know I remember this really well.(Laughter)But I don't know who felt worse that day. Was it me or the teacher? She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds. And without the humor. You know, when you see people get roasted on TV, it was funny. There was nothing funny about that day.So that was one version of me, and I would die to avoid being in that situation again \\u2014 to get rejected in public again. That's one version. Then fast-forward eight years. Bill Gates came to my hometown \\u2014 Beijing, China \\u2014 to speak, and I saw his message. I fell in love with that guy. I thought, wow, I know what I want to do now. That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them: \\\"By age 25, I will build the biggest company in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft.\\\"(Laughter)I totally embraced this idea of conquering the world \\u2014 domination, right? And I didn't make this up, I did write that letter. And here it is \\u2014(Laughter)You don't have to read this through \\u2014(Laughter)This is also bad handwriting, but I did highlight some key words. You get the idea.(Laughter)So ... that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world.Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States. I jumped on it, because that was where Bill Gates lived, right?(Laughter)I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey. Then, fast-forward another 14 years. I was 30. Nope, I didn't build that company. I didn't even start. I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company. And I felt I was stuck; I was stagnant. Why is that? Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter? It's not because he didn't try. It's because every time I had a new idea, every time I wanted to try something new, even at work \\u2014 I wanted to make a proposal, I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group \\u2014 I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old. One wanted to conquer the world \\u2014 make a difference \\u2014 another was afraid of rejection. And every time that six-year-old won.And this fear even persisted after I started my own company. I mean, I started my own company when I was 30 \\u2014 if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start sooner or later, right? When I was an entrepreneur, I was presented with an investment opportunity, and then I was turned down. And that rejection hurt me. It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there. But then I thought, hey, would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection? Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that? No way. And this is where it clicked for me. OK, I can build a better company. I can build a better team or better product, but one thing for sure: I've got to be a better leader. I've got to be a better person. I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore. I have to put him back in his place.So this is where I went online and looked for help. Google was my friend.(Laughter)I searched, \\\"How do I overcome the fear of rejection?\\\" I came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from. Then I came up with a bunch of \\\"rah-rah\\\" inspirational articles about \\\"Don't take it personally, just overcome it.\\\" Who doesn't know that?(Laughter)But why was I still so scared? Then I found this website by luck. It's called rejectiontherapy.com.(Laughter)\\\"Rejection Therapy\\\" was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur. His name is Jason Comely. And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain. And I loved that idea.(Laughter)I said, \\\"You know what? I'm going to do this. And I'll feel myself getting rejected 100 days.\\\" And I came up with my own rejection ideas, and I made a video blog out of it.And so here's what I did. This is what the blog looked like. Day One ...(Laughter)Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger. So this is where I went to where I was working. I came downstairs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk. He looked like a security guard. So I just approached him. And I was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life \\u2014 hair on the back of my neck standing up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding. And I got there and said, \\\"Hey, sir, can I borrow 100 dollars from you?\\\"(Laughter)And he looked up, he's like, \\\"No.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\"And I just said, \\\"No? I'm sorry.\\\" Then I turned around, and I just ran.(Laughter)I felt so embarrassed. But because I filmed myself \\u2014 so that night I was watching myself getting rejected, I just saw how scared I was. I looked like this kid in \\\"The Sixth Sense.\\\" I saw dead people.(Laughter)But then I saw this guy. You know, he wasn't that menacing. He was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, \\\"Why?\\\" In fact, he invited me to explain myself. And I could've said many things. I could've explained, I could've negotiated. I didn't do any of that. All I did was run. I felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life. Every time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as I could. And you know what? The next day, no matter what happens, I'm not going to run. I'll stay engaged.Day Two: Request a \\\"burger refill.\\\"(Laughter)It's when I went to a burger joint, I finished lunch, and I went to the cashier and said, \\\"Hi, can I get a burger refill?\\\"(Laughter)He was all confused, like, \\\"What's a burger refill?\\\"(Laughter)I said, \\\"Well, it's just like a drink refill but with a burger.\\\" And he said, \\\"Sorry, we don't do burger refill, man.\\\"(Laughter)So this is where rejection happened and I could have run, but I stayed. I said, \\\"Well, I love your burgers, I love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, I will love you guys more.\\\"(Laughter)And he said, \\\"Well, OK, I'll tell my manager about it, and maybe we'll do it, but sorry, we can't do this today.\\\" Then I left. And by the way, I don't think they've ever done burger refill.(Laughter)I think they're still there. But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because I stayed engaged \\u2014 because I didn't run. I said, \\\"Wow, great, I'm already learning things. Great.\\\"And then Day Three: Getting Olympic Doughnuts. This is where my life was turned upside down. I went to a Krispy Kreme. It's a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part of the United States. I'm sure they have some here, too. And I went in, I said, \\\"Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols? Basically, you interlink five doughnuts together ... \\\" I mean there's no way they could say yes, right? The doughnut maker took me so seriously.(Laughter)So she put out paper, started jotting down the colors and the rings, and is like, \\\"How can I make this?\\\" And then 15 minutes later, she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings. And I was so touched. I just couldn't believe it. And that video got over five million views on Youtube. The world couldn't believe that either.(Laughter)You know, because of that I was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything. And I became famous. A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying, \\\"What you're doing is awesome.\\\" But you know, fame and notoriety did not do anything to me. What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground \\u2014 into this research project. I wanted to see what I could learn.And then I learned a lot of things. I discovered so many secrets. For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a \\\"no\\\" into a \\\"yes,\\\" and the magic word is, \\\"why.\\\"So one day I went to a stranger's house, I had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, \\\"Hey, can I plant this flower in your backyard?\\\"(Laughter)And he said, \\\"No.\\\" But before he could leave I said, \\\"Hey, can I know why?\\\" And he said, \\\"Well, I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard. I don't want to waste your flower. If you want to do this, go across the street and talk to Connie. She loves flowers.\\\" So that's what I did. I went across and knocked on Connie's door. And she was so happy to see me.(Laughter)And then half an hour later, there was this flower in Connie's backyard. I'm sure it looks better now.(Laughter)But had I left after the initial rejection, I would've thought, well, it's because the guy didn't trust me, it's because I was crazy, because I didn't dress up well, I didn't look good. It was none of those. It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted. And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral, using a sales term. I converted a referral.Then one day \\u2014 and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes. So for example, one day I went to a Starbucks, and asked the manager, \\\"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?\\\" He was like, \\\"What's a Starbucks greeter?\\\" I said, \\\"Do you know those Walmart greeters? You know, those people who say 'hi' to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you don't steal stuff, basically? I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers.\\\"(Laughter)Well, I'm not sure that's a good thing, actually \\u2014 Actually, I'm pretty sure it's a bad thing. And he was like, \\\"Oh\\\" \\u2014 yeah, this is how he looked, his name is Eric \\u2014 and he was like, \\\"I'm not sure.\\\" This is how he was hearing me. \\\"Not sure.\\\" Then I ask him, \\\"Is that weird?\\\" He's like, \\\"Yeah, it's really weird, man.\\\" But as soon as he said that, his whole demeanor changed. It's as if he's putting all the doubt on the floor. And he said, \\\"Yeah, you can do this, just don't get too weird.\\\"(Laughter)So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter. I said \\\"hi\\\" to every customer that walked in, and gave them holiday cheers. By the way, I don't know what your career trajectory is, don't be a greeter.(Laughter)It was really boring. But then I found I could do this because I mentioned, \\\"Is that weird?\\\" I mentioned the doubt that he was having. And because I mentioned, \\\"Is that weird?\\\", that means I wasn't weird. That means I was actually thinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing. And again, and again, I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question, I gained their trust. People were more likely to say yes to me.And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ... by asking. You know, I came from four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, \\\"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, but it'd be great if you became a teacher.\\\"(Laughter)But I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I didn't. But it has always been my dream to actually teach something. So I said, \\\"What if I just ask and teach a college class?\\\" I lived in Austin at the time, so I went to University of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors' doors and said, \\\"Can I teach your class?\\\" I didn't get anywhere the first couple of times. But because I didn't run \\u2014 I kept doing it \\u2014 and on the third try the professor was very impressed. He was like, \\\"No one has done this before.\\\" And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson. He said, \\\"Wow, I can use this. Why don't you come back in two months? I'll fit you in my curriculum.\\\" And two months later I was teaching a class.This is me \\u2014 you probably can't see, this is a bad picture. You know, sometimes you get rejected by lighting, you know?(Laughter)But wow \\u2014 when I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking. I used to think I have to accomplish all these things \\u2014 have to be a great entrepreneur, or get a PhD to teach \\u2014 but no, I just asked, and I could teach.And in that picture, which you can't see, I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. Why? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world, who change the way we live and the way we think, are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections. People like Martin Luther King, Jr., like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, or even Jesus Christ. These people did not let rejection define them. They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves. And they embraced rejection.And we don't have to be those people to learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it. Then I started embracing it. I turned that into the biggest gift in my life. I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities. I use my blog, I use my talk, I use the book I just published, and I'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection.When you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. Don't run. If you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well.Thank you.(Applause)\",\n          \"Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree \\u2014 which produced this painting \\u2014 moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines. I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic.And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons. Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women. That number is rising. Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison. Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes.In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. That, I think, is movement. We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That, I think, is movement. We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs \\u2014 the Oregon spotted frog \\u2014 for later release into protected wetlands. That, I think, is movement.And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. They're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence.And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change.Thank you very much.(Applause)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2464,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.ted.com/talks/bob_thurman_says_we_can_be_buddhas\\n\",\n          \"https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection\\n\",\n          \"https://www.ted.com/talks/nalini_nadkarni_life_science_in_prison\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Good morning. How are you?(Laughter)It\\'s been great, hasn\\'t it? I\\'ve been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I\\'m leaving.(Laughter)There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we\\'ve had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it\\'s put us in a place where we have no idea what\\'s going to happen, in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out.I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don\\'t you? I find this very interesting. If you\\'re at a dinner party, and you say you work in education — Actually, you\\'re not often at dinner parties, frankly.(Laughter)If you work in education, you\\'re not asked.(Laughter)And you\\'re never asked back, curiously. That\\'s strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They\\'re like, \"Oh my God,\" you know, \"Why me?\"(Laughter)\"My one night out all week.\"(Laughter)But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. Because it\\'s one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion, and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it\\'s education that\\'s meant to take us into this future that we can\\'t grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that\\'s been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years\\' time. And yet we\\'re meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.And the third part of this is that we\\'ve all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have — their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn\\'t she? Just seeing what she could do. And she\\'s exceptional, but I think she\\'s not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.(Applause) Thank you.(Applause)That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.(Laughter)So, 15 minutes left.(Laughter)Well, I was born... no.(Laughter)I heard a great story recently — I love telling it — of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I\\'m drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will, in a minute.\"(Laughter)When my son was four in England — Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.(Laughter)If we\\'re being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?(Laughter)No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.(Laughter)\"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn\\'t have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, \"You OK with that?\" And he said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\"(Laughter)What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don\\'t know, they\\'ll have a go. Am I right? They\\'re not frightened of being wrong. I don\\'t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you\\'re not prepared to be wrong, you\\'ll never come up with anything original — if you\\'re not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we\\'re now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don\\'t grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this?I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.(Laughter)Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare\\'s father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don\\'t think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don\\'t think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody\\'s English class, wasn\\'t he?(Laughter)How annoying would that be?(Laughter)\"Must try harder.\"(Laughter)Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now! And put the pencil down.\"(Laughter)\"And stop speaking like that.\"(Laughter)\"It\\'s confusing everybody.\"(Laughter)Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn\\'t want to come. I\\'ve got two kids; he\\'s 21 now, my daughter\\'s 16. He didn\\'t want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He\\'d known her for a month.(Laughter)Mind you, they\\'d had their fourth anniversary, because it\\'s a long time when you\\'re 16. He was really upset on the plane, he said, \"I\\'ll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly —(Laughter)Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.(Laughter)But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn\\'t matter where you go. You\\'d think it would be otherwise, but it isn\\'t. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too, there\\'s a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn\\'t an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they\\'re allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don\\'t we? Did I miss a meeting?(Laughter)Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say \"What\\'s it for, public education?\" I think you\\'d have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners — I think you\\'d have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn\\'t it? They\\'re the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.(Laughter)And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn\\'t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They\\'re just a form of life, another form of life. But they\\'re rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them. There\\'s something curious about professors in my experience — not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads. They live up there, and slightly to one side. They\\'re disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.(Laughter)Don\\'t they? It\\'s a way of getting their head to meetings.(Laughter)If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.(Laughter)And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.(Laughter)Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.(Laughter)Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there\\'s a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don\\'t do music, you\\'re not going to be a musician; don\\'t do art, you won\\'t be an artist. Benign advice — now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they\\'re not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn\\'t valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can\\'t afford to go on that way.In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people, and it\\'s the combination of all the things we\\'ve talked about — technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.Suddenly, degrees aren\\'t worth anything. Isn\\'t that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn\\'t have a job, it\\'s because you didn\\'t want one. And I didn\\'t want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It\\'s a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.We know three things about intelligence. One, it\\'s diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn\\'t divided into compartments. In fact, creativity — which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value — more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.By the way, there\\'s a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It\\'s thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. Because you are, aren\\'t you? There\\'s a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home — which is not often, thankfully.(Laughter)No, she\\'s good at some things, but if she\\'s cooking, she\\'s dealing with people on the phone, she\\'s talking to the kids, she\\'s painting the ceiling, she\\'s doing open-heart surgery over here. If I\\'m cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone\\'s on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I\\'m trying to fry an egg in here.\"(Laughter)\"Give me a break.\"(Laughter)Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\"(Laughter)And the third thing about intelligence is, it\\'s distinct. I\\'m doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I\\'m fascinated by how people got to be there. It\\'s really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She\\'s a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She\\'s wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the \\'30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn\\'t concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they\\'d say she had ADHD. Wouldn\\'t you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn\\'t been invented at this point. It wasn\\'t an available condition.(Laughter)People weren\\'t aware they could have that.(Laughter)Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, \"I\\'ve listened to all these things your mother\\'s told me, I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We\\'ll be back; we won\\'t be very long,\" and they went and left her.But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn\\'t sick; she\\'s a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\"I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can\\'t tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn\\'t sit still. People who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She\\'s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she\\'s given pleasure to millions, and she\\'s a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.(Applause)What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won\\'t serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we\\'re educating our children.There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish.\" And he\\'s right.What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we\\'ve talked about. And the only way we\\'ll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way — we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.Thank you very much.(Applause)'"

work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area, vaishali, and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. all the young people, actually, from the city. the old fogeys dont come because theyre mad at buddha, because when he came to their city he accepted \\u2014 he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is, and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person, raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.so he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling: \\\"hes supposed to be religious and all this. whats he doing over there at amrapalis house with all his  monks,\\\" and so on. they were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him. they wouldnt go listen to him. but the young people all came. and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground. and as soon as they had laid all these, all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india, he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium, the wonder of the universe. everyone looked in that, and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.and of course, in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it, and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. so they dont \\u2014 when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky \\u2014 they dont just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. and then leilei \\u2014 i know his other name \\u2014 told us about interconnection, and how were all totally interconnected here, and how weve all known each other. and of course in the buddhist universe, weve already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past. and i didnt give the talk always. you did, and we had to watch you, and so forth. and were all still trying to, i guess were all trying to become tedsters, if thats a modern form of enlightenment. i guess so. because in a way, if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, its the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything thats going on everywhere in the planet.and therefore it will become intolerable \\u2014 what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us, totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is, and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place, or theyre being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. it just becomes intolerable. with all of us knowing everything, were kind of forced by technology to become buddhas or something, to become enlightened.and of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do, a little bit tired, we do suffer. we do enjoy our misery in a certain way. we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own, and ultimately it fails of course, and then were back into this thing.because our egocentric perception \\u2014 from the buddhas point of view, misperception \\u2014 is that all we are is what is inside our skin. and its inside and outside, self and other, and other is all very different. and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception, a little bit, right? you know, someone sitting next to you in a seat \\u2014 thats ok because youre in a theater, but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you, youd freak out. what do they want from me? like, whos that? and so you wouldnt sit that close to another person because of your notion that its you versus the universe \\u2014 thats all buddha discovered. because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us, and everyone else is different, then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesnt it? who is it whos going to get enough attention from the world? whos going to get enough out of the world? whos not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings \\u2014 if youre different from all the other beings?so where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way: through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually, knowing that you have no such boundary, knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. when you do that, youre forced to feel what they feel. luckily, they say \\u2014 i still am not sure \\u2014 but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature, they say, \\\"oh who would really want to be compassionate? how awful! im so miserable on my own. my head is aching. my bones are aching. i go from birth to death. im never satisfied. i never have enough, even if im a billionaire, i dont have enough. i need a hundred billion.\\\" so im like that. imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other peoples suffering. it would be terrible.but apparently, this is a strange paradox of life. when youre no longer locked in yourself, and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out, and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing, and realizing that you are the other being, somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. and you can, you get away from this terrible iron circle of i, me, me, mine, like the beatles used to sing.you know, we really learned everything in the s. too bad nobody ever woke up to it, and theyve been trying to suppress it since then. i, me, me, mine. its like a perfect song, that song. a perfect teaching. but when were relieved from that, we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. and we feel ourselves differently. its totally strange. its totally strange. the dalai lama always likes to say \\u2014 he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion, its because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. its really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know \\u2014 and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets. like, even when youre having a good time, when is the good time over? the good time is over when you think, how good is it? and then its never good enough.i love that leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time, doing it by having a good time. i think the dalai lama should have heard that. i wish hed been there to hear that. he once told me \\u2014 he looked kind of sad; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots. he looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago, they went and took everything away from the haves. you know, the big communist revolutions, russia and china and so forth. they took it all away by violence, saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse. they didnt help at all.so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today? and so then he looks at me. so i said, \\\"well, you know, youre all in this yourself. you teach: its generosity,\\\" was all i could think of. what is virtue? but of course, what you said, i think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun. it should be done by fun. generosity is more fun. thats the key. everybody has the wrong idea. they think buddha was so boring, and theyre so surprised when they meet dalai lama and hes fairly jolly. even though his people are being genocided \\u2014 and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nuns head, in every chinese prison. he feels it. he feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. i wont even say what they do. but he feels it. and yet hes very jolly. hes extremely jolly.because when you open up like that, then you cant just \\u2014 what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery? you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us. she scared us with the lava man. she scared us with the lava man is coming, then the tsunami is coming, but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful. its really lovely.so, compassion means to feel the feelings of others, and the human being actually is compassion. the human being is almost out of time. the human being is compassion because what is our brain for? now, jims brain is memorizing the almanac. but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did. he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. and he would have tremendous fun doing that.so the first person who gets happy, when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am i, where youre always dissatisfied \\u2014 as mick jagger told us. you never get any satisfaction that way. so then you decide, \\\"well, im sick of myself. im going to think of how other people can be happy. im going to get up in the morning and think, what can i do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?\\\" and the first person who gets happy when you do that, you dont do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself, because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. and you realize that this \\u2014 being with these people \\u2014 is the flower garden that chiho showed us. it is nirvana. and my time is up. and i know the ted commandments. thank you.\",\n          \"when i was six years old, i received my gifts. my first grade teacher had this brilliant idea. she wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of complimenting each other. so she had all of us come to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner. and she said, \\\"why dont we just stand here and compliment each other? if you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down.\\\" what a wonderful idea, right? what could go wrong?(laughter)well, there were  of us to start with, and every time i heard someones name called, i would give out the heartiest cheer. and then there were  people left, and  people left, and five left ... and three left. and i was one of them. and the compliments stopped. well, at that moment, i was crying. and the teacher was freaking out. she was like, \\\"hey, would anyone say anything nice about these people?\\\"(laughter)\\\"no one? ok, why dont you go get your gift and sit down. so behave next year \\u2014 someone might say something nice about you.\\\"(laughter)well, as im describing this you, you probably know i remember this really well.(laughter)but i dont know who felt worse that day. was it me or the teacher? she must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds. and without the humor. you know, when you see people get roasted on tv, it was funny. there was nothing funny about that day.so that was one version of me, and i would die to avoid being in that situation again \\u2014 to get rejected in public again. thats one version. then fast-forward eight years. bill gates came to my hometown \\u2014 beijing, china \\u2014 to speak, and i saw his message. i fell in love with that guy. i thought, wow, i know what i want to do now. that night i wrote a letter to my family telling them: \\\"by age , i will build the biggest company in the world, and that company will buy microsoft.\\\"(laughter)i totally embraced this idea of conquering the world \\u2014 domination, right? and i didnt make this up, i did write that letter. and here it is \\u2014(laughter)you dont have to read this through \\u2014(laughter)this is also bad handwriting, but i did highlight some key words. you get the idea.(laughter)so ... that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world.well, then two years later, i was presented with the opportunity to come to the united states. i jumped on it, because that was where bill gates lived, right?(laughter)i thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey. then, fast-forward another  years. i was . nope, i didnt build that company. i didnt even start. i was actually a marketing manager for a fortune  company. and i felt i was stuck; i was stagnant. why is that? where is that -year-old who wrote that letter? its not because he didnt try. its because every time i had a new idea, every time i wanted to try something new, even at work \\u2014 i wanted to make a proposal, i wanted to speak up in front of people in a group \\u2014 i felt there was this constant battle between the -year-old and the six-year-old. one wanted to conquer the world \\u2014 make a difference \\u2014 another was afraid of rejection. and every time that six-year-old won.and this fear even persisted after i started my own company. i mean, i started my own company when i was  \\u2014 if you want to be bill gates, youve got to start sooner or later, right? when i was an entrepreneur, i was presented with an investment opportunity, and then i was turned down. and that rejection hurt me. it hurt me so bad that i wanted to quit right there. but then i thought, hey, would bill gates quit after a simple investment rejection? would any successful entrepreneur quit like that? no way. and this is where it clicked for me. ok, i can build a better company. i can build a better team or better product, but one thing for sure: ive got to be a better leader. ive got to be a better person. i cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore. i have to put him back in his place.so this is where i went online and looked for help. google was my friend.(laughter)i searched, \\\"how do i overcome the fear of rejection?\\\" i came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from. then i came up with a bunch of \\\"rah-rah\\\" inspirational articles about \\\"dont take it personally, just overcome it.\\\" who doesnt know that?(laughter)but why was i still so scared? then i found this website by luck. its called rejectiontherapy.com.(laughter)\\\"rejection therapy\\\" was this game invented by this canadian entrepreneur. his name is jason comely. and basically the idea is for  days you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain. and i loved that idea.(laughter)i said, \\\"you know what? im going to do this. and ill feel myself getting rejected  days.\\\" and i came up with my own rejection ideas, and i made a video blog out of it.and so heres what i did. this is what the blog looked like. day one ...(laughter)borrow  dollars from a stranger. so this is where i went to where i was working. i came downstairs and i saw this big guy sitting behind a desk. he looked like a security guard. so i just approached him. and i was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life \\u2014 hair on the back of my neck standing up, i was sweating and my heart was pounding. and i got there and said, \\\"hey, sir, can i borrow  dollars from you?\\\"(laughter)and he looked up, hes like, \\\"no.\\\" \\\"why?\\\"and i just said, \\\"no? im sorry.\\\" then i turned around, and i just ran.(laughter)i felt so embarrassed. but because i filmed myself \\u2014 so that night i was watching myself getting rejected, i just saw how scared i was. i looked like this kid in \\\"the sixth sense.\\\" i saw dead people.(laughter)but then i saw this guy. you know, he wasnt that menacing. he was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, \\\"why?\\\" in fact, he invited me to explain myself. and i couldve said many things. i couldve explained, i couldve negotiated. i didnt do any of that. all i did was run. i felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life. every time i felt the slightest rejection, i would just run as fast as i could. and you know what? the next day, no matter what happens, im not going to run. ill stay engaged.day two: request a \\\"burger refill.\\\"(laughter)its when i went to a burger joint, i finished lunch, and i went to the cashier and said, \\\"hi, can i get a burger refill?\\\"(laughter)he was all confused, like, \\\"whats a burger refill?\\\"(laughter)i said, \\\"well, its just like a drink refill but with a burger.\\\" and he said, \\\"sorry, we dont do burger refill, man.\\\"(laughter)so this is where rejection happened and i could have run, but i stayed. i said, \\\"well, i love your burgers, i love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, i will love you guys more.\\\"(laughter)and he said, \\\"well, ok, ill tell my manager about it, and maybe well do it, but sorry, we cant do this today.\\\" then i left. and by the way, i dont think theyve ever done burger refill.(laughter)i think theyre still there. but the life and death feeling i was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because i stayed engaged \\u2014 because i didnt run. i said, \\\"wow, great, im already learning things. great.\\\"and then day three: getting olympic doughnuts. this is where my life was turned upside down. i went to a krispy kreme. its a doughnut shop in mainly the southeastern part of the united states. im sure they have some here, too. and i went in, i said, \\\"can you make me doughnuts that look like olympic symbols? basically, you interlink five doughnuts together ... \\\" i mean theres no way they could say yes, right? the doughnut maker took me so seriously.(laughter)so she put out paper, started jotting down the colors and the rings, and is like, \\\"how can i make this?\\\" and then  minutes later, she came out with a box that looked like olympic rings. and i was so touched. i just couldnt believe it. and that video got over five million views on youtube. the world couldnt believe that either.(laughter)you know, because of that i was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything. and i became famous. a lot of people started writing emails to me and saying, \\\"what youre doing is awesome.\\\" but you know, fame and notoriety did not do anything to me. what i really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. so i turned the rest of my  days of rejection into this playground \\u2014 into this research project. i wanted to see what i could learn.and then i learned a lot of things. i discovered so many secrets. for example, i found if i just dont run, if i got rejected, i could actually turn a \\\"no\\\" into a \\\"yes,\\\" and the magic word is, \\\"why.\\\"so one day i went to a strangers house, i had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, \\\"hey, can i plant this flower in your backyard?\\\"(laughter)and he said, \\\"no.\\\" but before he could leave i said, \\\"hey, can i know why?\\\" and he said, \\\"well, i have this dog that would dig up anything i put in the backyard. i dont want to waste your flower. if you want to do this, go across the street and talk to connie. she loves flowers.\\\" so thats what i did. i went across and knocked on connies door. and she was so happy to see me.(laughter)and then half an hour later, there was this flower in connies backyard. im sure it looks better now.(laughter)but had i left after the initial rejection, i wouldve thought, well, its because the guy didnt trust me, its because i was crazy, because i didnt dress up well, i didnt look good. it was none of those. it was because what i offered did not fit what he wanted. and he trusted me enough to offer me a referral, using a sales term. i converted a referral.then one day \\u2014 and i also learned that i can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes. so for example, one day i went to a starbucks, and asked the manager, \\\"hey, can i be a starbucks greeter?\\\" he was like, \\\"whats a starbucks greeter?\\\" i said, \\\"do you know those walmart greeters? you know, those people who say hi to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you dont steal stuff, basically? i want to give a walmart experience to starbucks customers.\\\"(laughter)well, im not sure thats a good thing, actually \\u2014 actually, im pretty sure its a bad thing. and he was like, \\\"oh\\\" \\u2014 yeah, this is how he looked, his name is eric \\u2014 and he was like, \\\"im not sure.\\\" this is how he was hearing me. \\\"not sure.\\\" then i ask him, \\\"is that weird?\\\" hes like, \\\"yeah, its really weird, man.\\\" but as soon as he said that, his whole demeanor changed. its as if hes putting all the doubt on the floor. and he said, \\\"yeah, you can do this, just dont get too weird.\\\"(laughter)so for the next hour i was the starbucks greeter. i said \\\"hi\\\" to every customer that walked in, and gave them holiday cheers. by the way, i dont know what your career trajectory is, dont be a greeter.(laughter)it was really boring. but then i found i could do this because i mentioned, \\\"is that weird?\\\" i mentioned the doubt that he was having. and because i mentioned, \\\"is that weird?\\\", that means i wasnt weird. that means i was actually thinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing. and again, and again, i learned that if i mention some doubt people might have before i ask the question, i gained their trust. people were more likely to say yes to me.and then i learned i could fulfill my life dream ... by asking. you know, i came from four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, \\\"hey jia, you can do anything you want, but itd be great if you became a teacher.\\\"(laughter)but i wanted to be an entrepreneur, so i didnt. but it has always been my dream to actually teach something. so i said, \\\"what if i just ask and teach a college class?\\\" i lived in austin at the time, so i went to university of texas at austin and knocked on professors doors and said, \\\"can i teach your class?\\\" i didnt get anywhere the first couple of times. but because i didnt run \\u2014 i kept doing it \\u2014 and on the third try the professor was very impressed. he was like, \\\"no one has done this before.\\\" and i came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson. he said, \\\"wow, i can use this. why dont you come back in two months? ill fit you in my curriculum.\\\" and two months later i was teaching a class.this is me \\u2014 you probably cant see, this is a bad picture. you know, sometimes you get rejected by lighting, you know?(laughter)but wow \\u2014 when i finished teaching that class, i walked out crying, because i thought i could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking. i used to think i have to accomplish all these things \\u2014 have to be a great entrepreneur, or get a phd to teach \\u2014 but no, i just asked, and i could teach.and in that picture, which you cant see, i quoted martin luther king, jr. why? because in my research i found that people who really change the world, who change the way we live and the way we think, are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections. people like martin luther king, jr., like mahatma gandhi, nelson mandela, or even jesus christ. these people did not let rejection define them. they let their own reaction after rejection define themselves. and they embraced rejection.and we dont have to be those people to learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. it has bothered me my whole life because i was running away from it. then i started embracing it. i turned that into the biggest gift in my life. i started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities. i use my blog, i use my talk, i use the book i just published, and im even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection.when you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. dont run. if you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well.thank you.(applause)\",\n          \"trees epitomize stasis. trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing. and i decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir, and what i learned was that different species have different signatures, like a picasso versus a monet.but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree \\u2014 which produced this painting \\u2014 moved in a single year, i simply measured and summed each of those lines. i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. you might have a guess. the answer is actually , miles, or seven times around the globe. and so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic.and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons. prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars. and our prison system itself is stuck. the united states has over . million incarcerated men and women. that number is rising. of the  incarcerated people that are released,  will return to prison. funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and i think the answer is yes.in the year , i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections. working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. we give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. that, i think, is movement. we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state. that, i think, is movement. we worked with the washington state department of fish and wildlife to grow endangered frogs \\u2014 the oregon spotted frog \\u2014 for later release into protected wetlands. that, i think, is movement.and just recently, weve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities. theyve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. theyre kept in bare cells like this for  hours a day. when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, theyre placed in immobile booths like this. for one hour a day theyre brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. although we cant bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. this is mr. lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for  months, and hes providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence.and so what we see, i think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. but if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change.thank you very much.(applause)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

(applause)over time, more photos came in, thankfully, and more retouchers were needed, and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin, and within five days,  people wanted to help from  different countries. within two weeks, i had  people wanting to join in. within japan, by july, wed branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata, further north to a town called yamada. once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up, where people were reclaiming their photos. the older ladies sometimes hadnt seen a scanner before, but within  minutes of them finding their lost photo, they could give it to us, have it scanned, uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded by a gaijin, a stranger, somewhere on the other side of the globe, and itd start being fixed.the time it took, however, to get it back is a completely different story, and it depended obviously on the damage involved. it could take an hour. it could take weeks. it could take months. the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn, or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadnt damaged. it was very time-consuming.now, all these photos had been damaged by water, submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria, in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time is going to continue to damage them, so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project. we couldnt retouch the photo unless it was cleaned, dry and reclaimed.now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning. we had an amazing local woman who guided us. its very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. as my team leader wynne once said, its like doing a tattoo on someone. you dont get a chance to mess it up.the lady who brought us these photos was lucky, as far as the photos go. she had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage. she also had duplicates. areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix, we could just put them together in one good photo, and remake the whole photo.when she collected the photos from us, she shared a bit of her story with us. her photos were found by her husbands colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood, and theyd recognized him. the day of the tsunami, hed actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys were both at school, separate schools. one of them got caught up in the water. it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived.the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest sons th birthday. for her, despite all of this, those photos were the perfect gift back to him, something he could look at again, something he remembered from before that wasnt still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed.after six months in japan, , volunteers had passed through all hands, hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over , photographs, the large majority \\u2014 (applause) \\u2014 a large majority of which did actually find their home again, importantly. over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get  families hundreds of photographs back, fully restored and retouched. during this time, we hadnt really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most of which was printer inks.we take photos constantly. a photo is a reminder of someone or something, a place, a relationship, a loved one. theyre our memory-keepers and our histories, the last thing we would grab and the first thing youd go back to look for. thats all this project was about, about restoring those little bits of humanity, giving someone that connection back.when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this, it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it.the projects also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. for some of them, its given them a connection to something bigger, giving something back, using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin.i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them, cindy, the day i finally got back from japan after six months.\\\"as i worked, i couldnt help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. one in particular, a photo of women of all ages, from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby, struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family, my grandmother and mother, myself, and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall. across the globe, throughout the ages, our basic needs are just the same, arent they?\\\" thank you.
